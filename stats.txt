History  ROUND ROBIN :
Number:  PID  FNAME  Priority  t_exec 
1        1554  ./fibb1.out    1    12.000          
2        1534  ./fibb2.out    4    4.000        
3        1555  ./fibb3.out    2    8.000   

running we can as as 2nd process is at highest priority we can see its exec in the least amounnt of time whereas number
1 took the most time hence its better to  consider assigning higher priorities to critical jobs to improve overall efficiency.
